# Jumper-Game
A simple jumper game where the player has to complete a certain amount of levels

This project was a bit more complex than my usual projects, mainly because there were different screens(ex: home, level_select, etc) and different levels. However, that didn't make it much harder.

This project seemed to be done fairly quickly. It only took 2 days(7 hours of dedicated work). I feel that was mainly because I wasn't debugging my code for more than about an hour. Maybe it is also because I decided to only make 6 levels.

Anyways, I had a lot of fun making this. I hope you enjoy playing my game.
